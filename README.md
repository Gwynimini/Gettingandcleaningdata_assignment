Assignment for Coursera course Getting and Cleaning data

This is the raw dataset that was used: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The script uses the data unzipped in the same folder without any changes to the files. 
My R script run_analysis.R has the script matching the 5 steps of the assignment. 
The codebook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
